# NCIT Neoplasia hierarchies

The hierarchy file is generated by extracting the "Neoplasia" subtree from the
latest NCIT thesaurus OWL file.

#### Procedure

* download the latest Thesaurus archive at https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/?C=M;O=D
  (e.g. Thesaurus_25.01d.OWL.zip)
* use Protege (download from https://protege.stanford.edu/software.php) to open
  the extracted .owl file (opening will take some time)
* navigate term tree to diseases and phenotypes => diseases => neoplasia
* CTRL-click on node and "copy sub-tree"
* paste sub-tree into empty text file
* go to the menue and find "show labels" or such
* again CTRL-click on node and "copy sub-tree" into _other new_ text file
* save both files as `ids.tsv` and `labels.tsv`
* run `tabbedTrees2hierarchies.py` from the same directory as those files
    - Note: The script adds an additional root node `NCIT:C132256	Unspecified Tissue`
      on top
* rename, archive etc.
